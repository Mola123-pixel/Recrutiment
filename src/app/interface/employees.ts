export interface Employees {   
    //some people are using classes instead of interface

    //Difference 
    //1. With classes we have to mention access identifier i.g public
     Id: number;
     Firstname: string;
     Lastname: string;
     Age: number;
     Job_title: string;
     Email_Address: string;
}
